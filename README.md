Task 1: EDA and Visualization of a Real-World Dataset
Load the Dataset: Use Pandas to load and explore the dataset.
          Dataset used is titanic dataset 
          In this data of drowned, died and rescued people with respect to their financial status and age e.t.c is present
    Dataset is read through pandas library of python.
    Head, description, info, null values, missing values are explored through EDA.
Data Cleaning:
        Missing values are detected filled with median for numerical values and mode for categorical values.
        Duplicate values are removed.
        Outliers are detected through IQR method.
Visualizations:
        BarChart is used for Categorical values.
        Histogram is used for Numerical values.
        HeatMap is used for Correlation.
Output is Shown in pictures.
